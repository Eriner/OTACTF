Marbles
=====================

Points: 100

```
A hat has an unknown number of coloured marbles, with equal numbers of each colour. Adding 20 marbles of a additional (new) colour to the hat would not change the probability of drawing (without replacement) two marbles of the same colour.

How many marbles are in the hat? (Before the additional 20 marbles are added)
